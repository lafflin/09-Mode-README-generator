WHEN I enter my project title
THEN this is displayed as the title of the README
WHEN I enter a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions
THEN this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests
WHEN I choose a license for my application from a list of options
THEN a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under

## My process

1. First I made all of the questions, then I followed up by adding the functionality for the license stuff, which took a while to figure out.
2. After this I got the file to write and fixed some weird formatting that was happening.
